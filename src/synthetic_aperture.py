    """
        This function crops the windows and the template from the center of the first frame. 
        
        The center of the template and window is defined by focus_center (e.g. 250,300). If focus_center is 
        not passed as argument (check wiith if focus_center == None ) , simply calculate the center of the image
        
        HINT: You need to calculate the top-left coordinate for both the window and the template
        where you want to start cropping
        
        You then can simply return these indices from your data.
        
        E.g. you could define something like
        
        x0 = 100
        y0 = 50
        x1 = x0 + size_x
        y1 = y0 + size y
        
        tmp = data[x0:x1,y0:y1]

        template_size(int): This int (e.g. 20) s the size of the template which we are cropping from the first frame of the video.

        img(ndarray): Video data with sahpe ((272, 480, 3, 51))
        focus_center(list): 2D array which is where we want to focus at. If none simply take the center of the image
        
    Returns:
        windows(ndarray): Should be (window_size,window_size,3,num_mgs)
        template(ndarray): Should be (template_size,window_size,3) - only once for initial frame
        top_left_window(list): top-left index coordinates where we are cropping the window_size e.g. [100,400]
        top_left_template(list): top-left index coorinates where the termplate is cropped e.g. [110,410]
