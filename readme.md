# Homework 6 - All about lightfields

Homework has two parts, hence you also have to work through two different Jupyter Notebooks, called 
1. part1_lightfield
2. part2_synthethic

In the first part we'll introduce you to the idea of the lightfield. We'll visualize the light-field, will work on a interpolation method for light-field data and will work on a digital refocusing algorithm of light-field data. For this we're first refocusing 1D-signals and will then go over to 2D-signals (i.e. images)

The second part is about how you can capture an "approximation" of a light-field with a smartphone camera using the video stream. We provide you with pre-captured video that you'll use for a synthethic refocusing. Eventually, you'll have a pipeline where you can capture your own light-field data to digitally synthesize your images.
